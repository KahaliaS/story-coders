# Story Coders

### Things that I have done:

- Create logo for Project
- Set up web pack
- Get a better understanding of functional react. I am now comfortable with Props, Components, State.
- Set up a basic React App that loads CSS and Images
- Add local project to Github
- Set up Nav component

### Things that I still have to do:

- Set up routes and basic CRUD functionality
- Set up my backend aka sql database (I do not think I need to set up a mongo db)
- React route handling?
- Properly design my site

  #### Nav:

  - Add react routing to nav items
  - Make nav sticky and transparent
  - Highlight or add border when hover over nav item
  - Change nav item size
